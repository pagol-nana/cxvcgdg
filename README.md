HALFTIME, Barcelona 1-1 Real Madrid: Barça were by far the better team in the first half and conceded a completely accidental opening goal, but never stopped attacking and got a deserved reward just before halftime. They have the momentum going into the second half, and this one is set up beautifully.

45’ GOAL!!! Barcelona 1-1 Real Madrid (Roberto): BARÇA EQUALIZE!!! A shot from Raphinha is blocked inside the box and the rebound falls to Sergi Roberto who takes a touch and finds the back of the net! A huge goal before halftime!

9’ GOAL, Barcelona 0-1 Real Madrid (Araujo OG): Madrid take the lead. Vinicius Junior attempts a cross into the box that hits Ronald Araujo and goes into the net. A very lucky goal for the visitors.

KICKOFF! Barcelona 0-0 Real Madrid: And we’re underway at Camp Nou!

Matchday Thread Rules
We don’t have a lot of rules here, but there are a few things to keep in mind when joining our matchday threads:

Even if the referee sucks or we lose the game, watch the swearing. It’s just unnecessary. Also, don’t discuss illegal streaming links. Those who do it will be warned, and those who post links will be instantly banned. Finally, be nice to each other. This is a Barcelona community and we don’t need to offend one another.

Have fun with the game! Forever and ever, no matter the competition, VISCA EL BARÇA!
